### Functional Programming Definition
- JavaScript functions are __firstclass citizens__ which means that functions can do the same things that variables can do.
- Techniques support this concept: __arrow functions__, __promises__, and __the spread operator__
- Functional programming is a part of a larger programming paradigm: _declarative programming_. Declarative programming is a style of programming where applications are structured in a way that prioritizes describing _what_ should happen over defining _how_ it should happen.

### Core concepts of functional programming
#### Immutability
- Data is immutable. It never changes.

#### Pure Functions
- Function that returns a value thatâ€™s computed based on its arguments

#### Data transformation
- Two core functions: __Array.map__ and __Array.reduce__
- Others: __Array.join__, __Array.filter__
- A _predicate_ is a function that always returns a Boolean value: true or false

#### Higher-order functions
- Higher-order functions are functions that can manipulate other functions


#### Recursion
